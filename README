Haskell bindings for TDB
Jelmer Vernooij <jelmer@samba.org>, 2006
------------------------
This directory contains initial work on haskell bindings for TDB. 

In order to compile this module, you will have to install both ghc, 
a recent version of c2hs and, of course, tdb.

Run:

chmod a+x Setup.hs
./Setup.hs configure
./Setup.hs build
./Setup.hs install

to build and install the bindings.

If you would like documentation as well, make sure you have 
'haddock' installed and run:

./Setup.hs haddock

The 'tests' directory contains a couple of small examples that use 
the TDB module.
